PICRUSt: Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States
=========================================================================================

The official PICRUSt source code repository. For details on PICRUSt, see http://picrust.github.com/.

The PICRUSt project aims to support prediction of unobserved states (e.g., metagenomes) from marker gene information about that community (e.g., 16S rRNA profiles). This is an open source, international, collaborative bioinformatics project developed in the Huttenhower, Beiko, Langille, Knight and Caporaso labs.
