PICRUSt: Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States
=========================================================================================

PICRUSt is a bioinformatics software package designed to predict metagenome functional content from marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) surveys and full genomes. **PICRUSt is currently pre-publication and under very active development.**

PICRUSt is freely available under the `GPL`_. However, since the software and documentation are still under very active development, all use of the software should be considered experimental and results should be interpreted with caution. 

Treat PICRUSt as beta software!
